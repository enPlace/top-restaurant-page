# top-restaurant-page
![](background-imgs/Screenshot_20210715_115327.png)

As a part of The Odin Project curriculum, this simple restaurant page is dynamically rendered, and all of its content is generated using JavaScript. The page was compiled using Webpack, and styled with CSS Flexbox and Grid.

The menu itself is an homage to the miriad of great breweries in Asheville, North Carolina, and the beer names on the menu come from either breweries there, my wife, or my dog.

 

Issues: 
    -gallery image sizes on some mobile browsers do not render to full size
    -when mobile screen height is too small, some overflow occurs in "contact" tab.
